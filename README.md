Data Analytics Portfolio
This portfolio includes a collection of foundational analytics work completed during my transition from a long career in finance into applied data and AI. The projects show how I work with real datasets, prepare them for analysis, and communicate insights in a clear and simple way. These early projects helped me build the base needed for more advanced work in computer vision, natural language processing, and full-stack data systems.
About This Portfolio
The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate practical skills in data extraction, cleaning, exploratory analysis, and introductory machine learning. Most of the work here is done in Python using tools such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook.
Coming from a finance background, I approached these projects the same way I approached financial reports: start with raw information, make it clean and reliable, explore it carefully, and explain what it means. This portfolio represents the first step in my journey into applied AI and supports the direction I am taking toward more technical roles and further studies.
Project Structure
This portfolio contains three main projects, each focusing on a different part of the analytics process.
Data Extraction and Cleaning
Notebook: 02_data_extraction.ipynb
This project covers loading and combining information from CSV and JSON files. It includes practical cleaning steps such as handling missing values, correcting column formats, and preparing the data for the next stage of analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis
Notebook: 03_eda.ipynb
This notebook explores the cleaned dataset to understand its structure and identify meaningful patterns. It includes descriptive statistics and visualizations that help explain the relationships within the data.
Introductory Machine Learning
Notebook: Titanic_Logistic_Regression.ipynb
This work applies a basic logistic regression model to the Titanic dataset. It includes model training, evaluation using common metrics, and a short interpretation of the results.
These projects reflect the foundation of my learning. The skills gained here supported my later work with larger and more complex projects such as object detection with YOLOv5, fabric classification with EfficientNet, and a full-stack sentiment analysis system.
Skills Demonstrated
This portfolio shows practical experience with:
Python programming
Data extraction from CSV and JSON files
Data cleaning and preparation
Exploratory data analysis
Simple data visualizations
Basic machine learning techniques
Clear project documentation
Organized project structure on GitHub
These skills connect directly to the requirements of modern analytics and AI work.

Reflection
Working through these projects helped me build confidence with core data tools and workflows. I learned how important it is to clean data properly, document each step, and understand the story behind the numbers. This work also helped me see how my finance background fits naturally with analytics. The same attention to detail, accuracy, and consistency that I used in budgeting and reporting is useful when working with datasets and building models.
This portfolio marks the beginning of my applied AI journey. Since completing these foundational projects, I have moved on to more advanced work in deep learning, model training, and full-stack systems, and I continue to build toward my goal of joining the MMAI program and working in applied AI.
